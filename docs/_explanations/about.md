### RoboFont 4

[RoboFont 4], released in July 2021, introduces 3 new APIs:

- [Merz], a completely new drawing back-end based on Apple’s [Core Animation Layer] framework. It is significantly faster than the previous API, and has an object-oriented approach.
- [Subscriber], a new notification manager that is meant to work along with Merz. It makes subscribing to application events easier and more efficient.
- [Ezui], a new toolkit that makes it easier to build user interfaces. It’s built on top of and is fully interoperable with [vanilla].
